1. Add display to receiver to show what channel it is set to and what channel is being broadcasted
2. Experiment with ways to introduce resiliency to the channel transmission (generally seems to be a timing issue)
5. Fix enhanced receiver schematic to move capacitor and put solar cells in series
7. Add feature to receiver to release transmission channel after a certain period of silence
8. Determine why channel transmission is so visible/audible and how to resolve it
9. Get receiver circuit working with enhancement MOSFET instead or relay
10. Determine why activation of relay to cut sound still allows a small amount of sound to pass through
11. Write unit tests
12. Audio noise is generated by incandescent room lighting, should be filtered out passively.
13. Adjust circuit component values to account for higher watt LEDs
14. Fill out passive-circuit-guidance.txt
15. Fill out enhanced-circuit-guidance.txt
16. Add abstraction to server code channel controller to close ports in base class if removed from implementation
17. Refactor channel transmitter class to be more general message transmitter and a more-scoped channel transmitter implementing it
18. Make imports in modules non-exportable
