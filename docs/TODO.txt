1. Add display to receiver to show what channel it is set to and what channel is being broadcasted
2. Experiment with ways to introduce resiliency to the channel transmission (generally seems to be a timing issue)
3. DONE
4. DONE
5. Create schematics
6. Write README
7. Add feature to receiver to release transmission channel after a certain period of silence
8. Determine why channel transmission is so visible/audible and how to resolve it
9. Get receiver circuit working with enhancement MOSFET instead or relay
10. Determine why activation of relay to cut sound still allows a small amount of sound to pass through
